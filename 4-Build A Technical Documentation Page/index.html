					Dart is a client-optimized language for developing fast apps on any platform. Its goal is to
					offer
					the most productive programming language for multi-platform development, paired with a flexible
					execution runtime platform for app frameworks.</p>
				<p>Languages are defined by their technical envelope — the choices made during development that
					shape
					the capabilities and strengths of a language. Dart is designed for a technical envelope that is
					particularly suited to client development, prioritizing both development (sub-second stateful
					hot
					reload) and high-quality production experiences across a wide variety of compilation targets
					(web,
					mobile, and desktop).</p>
				<p>Dart also forms the foundation of Flutter. Dart provides the language and runtimes that power
					Flutter
					apps, but Dart also supports many core developer tasks like formatting, analyzing, and testing
					code.

					The Java™ Programming Language is a general-purpose, concurrent, strongly typed, class-based
					object-oriented language. It is normally compiled to the bytecode instruction set and binary format
					defined in the Java Virtual Machine Specification.

					JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on
					web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for
					you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics,
					scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third
					layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in
					much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for
						example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the
						page.</li>
					<li>CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example
						setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.</li>
					<li>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content,
						control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but
						it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)</li>
				</ul>

					Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type
					inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of its standard
					library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise.

				<p>
					Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.
					Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it
					very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue
					language to connect existing components together. </p>
				<p>
					Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes
					readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and
					packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the
					extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major
					platforms, and can be freely distributed.
				</p>
				<p>Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since
					there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python
					programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the
					interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the
					exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local
					and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the
					code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's
					introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few
					print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very
					effective.</p>
