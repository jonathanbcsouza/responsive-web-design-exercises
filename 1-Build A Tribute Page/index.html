      >. Since then, he has been searching for how he could innovate in music
      but has never been able to find something that could completely match his
      artistic expectations. Back in 2016, he took some piano lessons and
      created a new music project where he tried to innovate, wrote poems and
      recorded some improvisations with piano, voice, and guitar. Back in early
      2017, he showed some of his compositions to friends and family, which
      turned out to some very good and inspiring feedbacks that motivated him to
      carry on and compose new songs. <br />
      He describes his songs as:
      <blockquote>"A drawing of all my feelings poured into music."</blockquote>
